First, create a wallet using `geth`.

1. you can grab the newest version here:
https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/archive/v1.7.3.tar.gz

2. Unarchive it somewhere.
3. Run the command 'creating an account' to create your wallet
https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Managing-your-accounts#creating-an-account
```
$ geth account new
Your new account is locked with a password. Please give a password. Do not forget this password.
Passphrase:
Repeat Passphrase:
Address: {xxxx}
```
4. Edit the following script by setting your public wallet address and mining box name
oldman@oldman-desktop2 /home/data/ether/bin $ cat go.sh 
#!/bin/bash
PUBLIC_WALLET_ADDRESS=5ab409037882d8efd890b69ef2491f01d711e9b8 # anyone can mine to this wallet, I'll explain more later
MINER_NAMN=desktop2 # used to distinguish between multiple miners contributing to a single wallet
GPU_FORCE_64BIT_PTR=0 # I have no idea if these params are required, but they don't seem to cause a problem...
GPU_MAX_HEAP_SIZE=100
GPU_USE_SYNC_OBJECTS=1
GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT=100
GPU_SINGLE_ALLOC_PERCENT=100

# get to mining!
./ethminer --farm-recheck 200 -G -S eu1.ethermine.org:4444 -FS us1.ethermine.org:4444 -O $PUBLIC_WALLET_ADDRESS.$MINER_NAME
```

5. Following is how mining works...

You can mine *solo* or in a *pool*, however mining solo these days is impractical due to 
the low payout rate.  This is because the process of mining is basically a series
of random attempts to compute an acceptible hash for a block and this process takes
a lot of cpu cycles.  The rest of how the block gets added to the block chain though,
I'm not sure, but I think I'm pretty sure it does make its way there somehow. So,
you want to mine in a pool and _share_ the work.  

When you mine in a pool, you get a payout at a regular frequency. The 
quantity of the payout is somehow determined by the number of *valid shares* that
your miner submits.  I'm not %100 sure, but I think the number of valid shares
you've computed is reflected by the `A1` part of the following log line.
```
  m  22:55:20|ethminer  Speed  29.90 Mh/s    gpu/0 29.90  [A1+0:R0+0:F0] Time: 00:00
```

regardless
of how much computing power you contribute over that week.  You are payed for each
*valid share* that your miner contributes.  

 computing
a hash for a bunch of transactions, aka a *block*.
You don't even need to create an account with ethermine.org.  Ethermine is a mining pool
where you share the work of mining (hashing blocks) with other miners.  The reason
to mine in a pool is because hashing a block is essentially a trial and error 
process and the probability of computing the correct hash is very low, so I guess
it takes a long time, something like months for a solo miner to predictably hash
a block.  There are other pools to choose from. I just chose this one because it
has been popular for a long time.

Here's a forum that you can search to find more info (this link is to a specific post though):
https://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/13308/been-successfully-mining-now-what

this program runs.  The program doesn't need to always run.  It only takes it maybe
a minute to download some in-memory representation of the blockchain.  Then mining
will commence and it will spit out some log messages as it goes.  I think the
most important thing for you to be looking there is the hash rate.  I think that 1070 should
be getting something like 20-28 MH/sec.
