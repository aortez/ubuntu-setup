# just some notes about how to configure firefox...

# Disable Automatic Updates
# I am often working on many things at once and have a lot of services signed into and whatnot
# in my browser, so it really sucks when FF gives me a forced update and restart, but fails to 
# restore my previous session. So, disabling automatic updates might help here...

set app.update.auto = false

This site says this will change the behavior from automatic to prompted, which sounds fucking
awesome:

So we'll see if it still works that way, hopefully!
